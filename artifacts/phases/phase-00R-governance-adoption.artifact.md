# Phase 00R: Governance Adoption & Baseline Establishment

**Phase Purpose:**
Formally adopt the Anti-Gravity Design/Execution governance model, initialize the repository structure, and pin the current state as "Legacy Baseline."

**Gate: APPROVE PLANNING**
- [x] 1. Initialize Governance Directories
- [x] 2. Document Legacy Baseline (Snapshot)
- [x] 3. Create Governance Boundary Declaration

## 1. Governance Initialization
- [x] Create `artifacts/` directory structure
- [x] Initialize `artifacts/repo_phase_index.md`
- [x] Verify `.agent/` contains only rules/workflows

## 2. Legacy Baseline Snapshot
- [x] Document current Tech Stack (Python 3.11, FastAPI, Vite, React 18)
- [x] Document Production Topology (Vercel + Railway + Supabase (Production))
- [x] Record current git commit hash as "Pre-Governance Baseline"

## 3. Boundary Declaration
- [x] Add "Governance Boundary" section to `Project_Rules.md` (or similar)
- [x] Declare all prior code "Legacy"
