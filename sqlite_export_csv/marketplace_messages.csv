Your custom-made cover is in our queue to be made.
You will receive an automated email very soon with a tracking number if you haven't already.

When a tracking # is issued, that means the cover is in our queue to be made and will be ready to ship soon. 
It can then take 24 - 48 hours from when it is issued to when the cover will be picked up, scanned and updated on the USPS/UPS/ or FEDEX website. 

This timing does not include holidays or weekends. However, it can also be updated before that as well.

If you’ve received a previous email from us confirming size & customization options and you have not responded,  we encourage you to still do so, ASAP.  Especially if there is something wrong with the information we have. Thanks!

We're glad we could help. If there are any problems at all with the cover, please contact us. We'll take care of you.

Your custom-made cover is in our queue to be made.

You will receive an automated email very soon with a tracking number if you haven't already.

When a tracking # is issued, that means the cover is in our queue to be made and will be ready to ship soon. 

It can then take 24 - 48 hours from when it is issued to when the cover will be picked up, scanned and updated on the USPS/UPS/ or FEDEX website. 

This timing does not include holidays or weekends. However, it can also be updated before that as well.

If you’ve received a previous email from us confirming size & customization options and you have not responded,  we encourage you to still do so, ASAP.  Especially if there is something wrong with the information we have. Thanks!

We're glad we could help. If there are any problems at all with the cover, please contact us. We'll take care of you.
